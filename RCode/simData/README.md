# R code for simulating data

* `sim1CreateGeneList.R` - Creates list of genes to be simulated for simulation 1
* `sim1CtsFromGeneList.R` - Simulates counts from the gene list provided in `sim1CreateGeneList.R`. Only genes which are assigned to one tissue are simulated.
* `sim1CtsFromGeneList_MixGenes.R` - Simulates counts for the genes which are a mixture of two brain tissues.
* `liverSpleenCreateCts.R` - Creates mixture of GTEx liver and GTEx spleen for second analyses in paper.
