# R code for distance pre processing

* `getGeneListForDistances.R` - Combines gene lists from all analyses to reduce GTEx set to a more manageable size

* `subsetGeneListDistanceLargeTissue.R` - Creates a reduced set of GTEx samples by selecting equally from tissue groups and subsetting to genes from `getGeneListForDistances.R`
