#R code for distances

* [preProcess](https://github.com/mccabes292/actorPaper/tree/master/code/distances/preProcess) - Programs to run prior to distance based analysis.
* `hellingerDistanceFunctionSimLargeTissue.R` - Calculate Hellinger distances for all samples simulation 1 in paper.
* `hellingerDistanceFunctionMixLargeTissue.R` - Calculate Hellinger distances for all samples simulation 2 (liver spleen mix) in paper.
* `hellingerDistanceFunctionClusterBrainLargeTissue.R` - Calculate Hellinger distances for all samples in the real data set
* `makeDistancePlotsPaper.R` - Create plots using the results from the previous three programs.
